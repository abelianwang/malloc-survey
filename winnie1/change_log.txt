Winnie Alloc library.

ver 0.5:

Winnie::Realloc function was added
winnie_alloc headers moved to "include" folder.
SystemAlloc now use 'malloc' function instead 'VirtualAlloc' to avoid memory leaks in DLL undloading context
Minimal block size of memory taked from OS was reduced to 1 megabyte
'throw_std_bad_alloc' constant from Winnie::Config was replaced by WINNIE_ALLOC_THROW_STD_BADALLOC macro

ver 0.4:
walloc_test - 
`op_new_break_alloc` variable (to set break on block allocation with specified number)
now in debug mode all blocks are linked to list, so you can enumerate them all 
(for seeking memory leaks, for example)
Many other useful debug functions now available(OpNewValidateHeap and other)

tracking is block array or not were mixed up in new(nothrow) and new(nothrow)[]. Fixed.

winnie_alloc -
nothing changed


ver 0.3:

walloc_test - 
example of (optional) multithreading support, 
adding operator void *operator new/new[](size_t size, const std::nothrow_t&)
transfer definitions of operators new/delete to file `new_delete.cpp` (now you can just add to your project, or copy'n'paste)
many asserts were added, which raise in debug mode.
new/delete now can be cofigured by new_delete_config.h 

winnie_alloc -
renamed Winnie::Statistic::num_block_allocatons to Winnie::Statistic::num_block_allocations *^_^*
USE_MALLOC_THRESHOLD parameter added to winie_alloc_config.h
